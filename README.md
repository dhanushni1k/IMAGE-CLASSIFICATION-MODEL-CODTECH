Project Title: Image Classification with TensorFlow
Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of an image classification model using TensorFlow. It leverages the powerful tensorflow.keras API to build, train, and evaluate a deep learning model on a custom dataset. The dataset consists of labeled images of different classes, which are organized into subdirectories, each representing a different category. The project also includes a model training pipeline that prepares the dataset, builds a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), and evaluates the model on both training and validation data.

Features
Custom Dataset Handling: The dataset is loaded using TensorFlow's image_dataset_from_directory method, which allows for easy loading of images organized in a directory structure. The dataset is divided into training and validation sets, and the images are resized to a standard size for uniformity during training.

Image Preprocessing: The images are resized to a consistent size (32x32 pixels) to ensure that they can be input into the neural network. The data is then fed into the model in batches to efficiently process large datasets.

Model Architecture: The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are commonly used for image classification tasks. The CNN consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by dense layers that help in learning spatial hierarchies in the image data.

Training Pipeline: The project includes a training pipeline that compiles the model, defines the loss function and optimizer, and trains the model using the fit method. During training, the loss and accuracy of the model are printed in real-time, helping to monitor the training progress.

Evaluation and Results: After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the validation dataset, and the accuracy is printed. This allows users to gauge the effectiveness of the model in classifying unseen images.

Visualization: The project also offers the option to visualize the training process using matplotlib. This allows for easy inspection of the training and validation accuracy over multiple epochs to assess whether the model is overfitting or underfitting.

Technologies Used
TensorFlow: A powerful open-source library for machine learning and deep learning. TensorFlow's keras API is used to define, train, and evaluate the deep learning model.

Keras: Keras is the high-level neural network API used in TensorFlow to simplify the creation and training of deep learning models.

Python: The programming language used for writing the model code and training pipeline.

Matplotlib: A plotting library used to visualize training metrics such as loss and accuracy over time.

Installation
Clone the Repository:

Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/dhanushni1k/IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION-MODEL-CODTECH/tree/main
Install Dependencies:

Install the required dependencies using pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset Preparation:

Prepare your dataset by organizing images into a directory structure like this:
markdown
Copy code
dataset/
    train/
        class1/
        class2/
    validation/
        class1/
        class2/
Run the Code:

You can run the model training script in your environment using:
bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Model Training
The model is trained using the fit method provided by TensorFlow. During training, the modelâ€™s performance is measured by the loss and accuracy metrics. Once training is complete, the model's evaluation results are printed, indicating how well it performs on unseen validation data.
Usage
After the model is trained, you can use it for inference on new image data. You can use model.predict() to classify images from the same dataset or any new images that match the trained classes.
